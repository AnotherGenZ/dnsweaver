## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

Only the latest patch release of the current major.minor version receives
security updates. Upgrade to the latest release to ensure you have all fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

To report a vulnerability, use one of the following methods:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories (preferred):**
   [Open a private security advisory](https://github.com/maxfield-allison/dnsweaver/security/advisories/new)
   on the GitHub repository. This ensures the report remains private until a fix
   is available.

2. **Email:** Send details to the maintainer via the email listed on the
   [GitHub profile](https://github.com/maxfield-allison).

### What to Include

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce (or proof of concept)
- Affected version(s)
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if any)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment** within 72 hours of receipt
- **Initial assessment** within 1 week
- **Fix timeline** communicated after assessment — typically within 30 days for
  critical issues, 90 days for lower severity
- **Credit** in the release notes (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Practices

dnsweaver follows these security practices:

- **Container image scanning:** Trivy scans every build for CRITICAL and HIGH
  CVEs — builds are blocked until resolved or explicitly acknowledged
- **Dependency scanning:** `govulncheck` runs against the Go vulnerability
  database on every pipeline
- **Secret detection:** Gitleaks scans all commits for leaked credentials
- **Static analysis:** `gosec` runs as part of the linting pipeline
- **Hardened runtime image:** Production images are based on
  [Docker Hardened Images](https://hub.docker.com/hardened-images/catalog/dhi/alpine-base)
  (Alpine), run as non-root, and contain no shell utilities beyond busybox
- **Minimal attack surface:** No wget, curl, or unnecessary packages in
  production images
- **Input validation:** Shell metacharacter filtering, HTTP response body limits,
  and DNS record validation at all input boundaries

## Dependency Management

- Direct dependencies are kept current and reviewed regularly
- Known CVEs in dependencies are tracked in `.trivyignore` with documented
  justification and review dates
- The project uses `go mod` with `-mod=readonly` to prevent unintended
  dependency changes

## Disclosure Policy

We follow [coordinated vulnerability disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_vulnerability_disclosure).
We ask that reporters give us reasonable time to address issues before public
disclosure. We will coordinate with you on disclosure timing and credit.
